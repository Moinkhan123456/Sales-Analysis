# Sales-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
I have developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating dashboard and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data processing, data cleaning, data modelling & data visualization.

Sales Analysis Dashboard in Excel
1. Overview of the Dashboard
The Sales Analysis Dashboard provides insights into revenue generation, customer orders, product categories, and geographical trends. It includes key metrics such as:
<br>
Total Orders: 1000
<br>
Total Revenue: ₹35,20,984.00
<br>
Average Customer Spending: ₹3,520.98
<br>
Order-Delivery Time Analysis
<br>
The dashboard consists of various visual elements:
<br>
Revenue by Occasions
<br>
Revenue by Category
<br>
Revenue by Hour (Order Time)
<br>
Revenue by Months
<br>
Top 5 Products by Revenue
<br>
Top 10 Cities by Orders

2. Data Modeling
Data modeling ensures the organization of raw data into structured datasets that support efficient analysis. Key tasks completed:
<br>
Defined relationships between various entities such as orders, customers, products, and time dimensions.
<br>
Data source integration from raw sales records.
<br>
Created pivot tables to aggregate and summarize data for visualization.
<br>

3. Data Cleaning
Data cleaning was performed to ensure accurate and consistent data. Tasks include:
<br>
Handling missing values: Filled missing order dates or revenue details using interpolation or historical trends.
<br>
Standardizing formats: Converted inconsistent date formats into a standard format.
<br>
Removing duplicates: Eliminated redundant entries in sales transactions.
<br>
Ensuring categorical consistency: Standardized names for occasions, product categories, and cities.
<br>

4. Data Processing
Data transformation and calculations were performed to derive key metrics:
<br>
Calculated total revenue, total orders, and average spending.
<br>
Derived order-to-delivery time by computing the difference between order date and delivery date.
<br>
Created time-based aggregations for monthly, hourly, and occasion-based revenue tracking.

6. Data Visualization
The dashboard contains multiple charts to represent insights:
<br>
Bar Charts: Used for revenue by category and occasions.
<br>
Line Charts: Depicts trends such as revenue by months and revenue by order time.
<br>
Top N Analysis: Highlights the top 5 products by revenue and top 10 cities by order count.
<br>
Filters & Slicers: Implemented for interactive selection of date ranges and occasions.
